# Python Script to Retrieve and Display Top 100 Male Users from RandomUser API

This Python script uses the RandomUser API, the requests python package, and the tabulate python package to retrieve and list the top 100 male users. The project demonstrates how to access and parse API data using Python, as well as how to filter and manipulate data to display only the desired information.

In addition to the main code file, the repository also contains a requirements.txt file listing the required Python packages, a README.md file with instructions on how to run the code and additional information about the project and .vscode folder which contains setting for VSCode using the Black python formatter and Isort.
